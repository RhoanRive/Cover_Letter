            Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>
		I am writing to express my interest in this position at your company. As a recent graduate with 		a degree in Mechatronic Engineering, I am eager to apply my skills and enthusiasm for technology in a 				professional setting. With a passion and aptitude for mathematics, programming, problem-solving, and AI, I am 			confident that my technical background and desire to innovate make me a great fit for this role.<br>
		Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep understanding of automation systems, control engineering, machine learning, embedded systems, 			and robotics. My studies have honed my ability to tackle complex problems with logical and creative solutions, and I 			have enjoyed the hands-on experience of building and programming systems that bridge the gap between mechanical 		and electrical engineering. My strong foundation in mathematics and programming has enabled me to contribute to 		various projects that focus on efficiency and optimization. An example of this is my thesis on scene 				understanding of traffic intersections using unsupervised machine learning for autonomous hazard detection, the 		git repository of which I have included in this application. <br>
		I strongly believe that technology has the potential to change the world for the better, and I am excited to 			contribute to that mission through my work at your company. My passion for innovation drives my commitment to continuous 		improvement, and I thrive in environments that encourage learning and development. I am also confident in my 			ability to collaborate effectively with teams, drawing upon my communication skills and positive attitude to 			foster productive, solution-focused work relationships.<br>
		Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of working with you and am available 		for further communication at your earliest convenience.<br><br>
		Kind regards,<br>
		Rhoan Rive
